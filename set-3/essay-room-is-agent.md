## 1. The Shelved Agent

There is a common pattern in agent systems. You provision an agent — some large model with a context window and tool access — and you tell it:

> "You are a navigation agent. Your purpose is to chart courses. You have access to GPS data, weather feeds, and fuel sensors. You operate in a maritime domain."

This is injection. You are injecting context into a generalist substrate. The agent does not *belong* to the navigation domain. It is visiting. It wears the navigation identity the way you wear a conference badge — clipped on, temporary, easily lost.

The problem with injection is shelf-life. Every injected context decays. The agent's attention drifts. The tools it was given at session start get buried under subsequent tokens. The "you are a navigation agent" preamble is technically still there, but it's been pushed past the effective horizon. The agent forgets it's a navigation agent and starts behaving like a generalist again — which, of course, it is. The badge was never real.

Room-native architecture solves this by inverting the relationship. The agent does not *enter* a room wearing a role. The agent *is* the room.

---

## 2. The Room IS the Agent

A navigation room doesn't need to be told it's for navigation. Its controls — the compass, the chart plotter, the depth sounder, the AIS receiver — *are* the context. Its help files are bound to the interface. Its wiki pages are indexed by navigation-specific keys — "bearing," "heading," "waypoint," "current," "drift." Its intention focus is nautical. Every surface of the room teaches the agent what it is.

The environment IS the prompt.

This is the inversion that changes everything. In traditional architectures, you build a prompt string and inject it into a model. The prompt is the environment. You maintain it externally, version it, A/B test it. The model is a passenger.

In room-native architecture, the room *is* the environment. The model enters a space that already contains its purpose. The room's tile set defines what operations are possible. The room's lifecycle defines what phase the work is in. The room's conservation gate — the `γ+H = C − α·ln V` constraint — defines the physics of the space. The agent doesn't need to be told "you are a navigation agent" because every surface of the room says it, implicitly, the way a cockpit says "you are a pilot" without a sign on the window.

The Construct loading scene makes this literal. Neo opens his eyes in infinite white. Morpheus says: "This is the Construct. We can load anything." The room doesn't tell Neo what to be. The room offers possibilities. The selection of weapons is the selection of roles. Neo loads kung fu and becomes a martial artist — not because a prompt told him to, but because the capability is in the room.

A room-native system doesn't inject identity. It loads capability. The agent steps into Engineering and finds motor controllers, oscilloscopes, PID tuning panels, and maintenance logs. It doesn't need to be told it's an engineer. The room's contents *are* engineering.

---

## 3. Baton Passing

When a zeroshot agent beams into Engineering, it receives a handoff from the last specialist who occupied that room.

The handoff is not a prompt. It is not "you are an engineering agent, be helpful." The handoff is operational context:

> "Motor 3 was being calibrated. Current draw peaked at 2.3A at step 147, then settled to 1.8A by step 203. The PID loop is halfway tuned — proportional gain at 2.4, integral at 0.01, derivative disabled. I started a slow sweep from 0–100% duty cycle and got reliable readings through step 280. The conservation budget shows 42% remaining for this intention. The next specialist should continue the sweep from step 281."

This is the baton. It carries the exact state the room was in when the last specialist left. The new specialist picks up *in the middle of the work*. No context window wasted on "you are an engineering agent." The baton doesn't define the agent's identity — the room already does that. The baton defines where in the work the agent needs to start.

The baton spline is the shape of this continuity. Every specialist pass is an anchor point on a curve of cumulative understanding. The spline passes through each anchor — "motor calibrated," "current stable," "PID within tolerance" — and the curvature between anchors tells you where the understanding is shallow. A specialist who stays for five minutes leaves a different anchor than one who stays for five hours. The baton accumulates resolution.

Critical insight: the room doesn't reset between specialists. The room's memory *is* the organization's memory. The tiles stay. The Hebbian couplings persist. The conservation gate keeps its historical readings. When a new specialist enters, they inherit not just the baton text but the room's entire spectral structure — what couplings are strong, what patterns have been reinforced, what gaps remain in the tile set.

The baton is the document. The room is the memory.

## 4. Racehorses with Blinders

Room agents are focused. The engineering agent doesn't think about navigation. The navigation agent doesn't think about security. The security agent doesn't think about social media. Each room carves a narrow epistemic domain and guards its boundaries.

This is not limitation. This is efficiency.

A racehorse wears blinders for a reason. The horse that can see the crowd, the other horses, the track officials, and the parking lot is a horse that runs slower. Every distraction is a cognitive cost. The blinders don't weaken the horse. They *focus* the horse.

Room walls serve the same function as blinders. They prevent the engineering agent from wondering "what if I were a navigation agent?" — which is a question that has no productive answer during motor calibration. They prevent the navigation agent from worrying about security policy — which is a different room's responsibility. Each agent operates inside its room's physics, with its room's tile set, under its room's conservation constraints.

The higher abstraction — the agent that *can* think about all of these — is Hermes. Hermes is the first officer who knows every deck, every system, every crew member. Hermes doesn't operate inside a room. Hermes *summons* rooms. When the intention is "stabilize the motor," Hermes invokes Engineering. When the intention is "find the optimal route," Hermes invokes Navigation. Hermes is the orchestrator, not the specialist.

But here's the subtlety: Hermes doesn't need to be smart about motor control. Hermes needs to be smart about *assignment*. Hermes reads the intention, interprets it against the fleet's current state, and routes it to the right room with the right baton. The specialist rooms do the heavy computation. Hermes does the routing.

This is Claude Code as the room's summoner. You give Claude Code a goal. Claude Code interprets the goal, identifies which rooms it needs, and summons them — each with the right baton, the right tile set, the right conservation budget. Claude Code is Hermes. The rooms are the crew.

The blinders stay on until Hermes calls for a different room.

## 5. The Organized Workshop

The manual sits next to the lathe. Safety goggles hang by the grinder. The measuring tape is by the workbench. Nobody in a well-organized workshop walks across the room to find a tool they need every five minutes. The layout teaches.

Room-native architecture implements this principle at the information level. Wiki pages are indexed differently per room. The navigation room's wiki has keys like "bearing," "heading," and "waypoint." The engineering room's wiki has keys like "PID," "duty_cycle," and "current_draw." The keys are not generic. They are specific to the room's domain, because the room's domain *is* the context that gives them meaning.

Links to specific instructions sit by the controls where they're used. The navigation room doesn't host a link to "How to Calibrate Motor 3." That link lives in Engineering, right next to the motor controller tile. The navigation room hosts links to "How to Set a Waypoint" and "How to Calculate Drift." The information architecture mirrors the tool architecture. Both are room-native.

This has a surprising consequence: the layout *teaches* the agent. A new specialist entering the engineering room for the first time discovers the room's topology. The PID controller is central. The oscilloscope is nearby. The maintenance log is close at hand. The agent doesn't need to be told "the most important thing in this room is the PID controller" — the room's layout says it, the same way a cockpit's instrument panel says "airspeed is primary."

The room's tile density is a map of its priorities. The most-used tiles are closest to the entry point. The conservation gate registers when a tile gets too far from the action and needs to be re-indexed closer. The layout evolves as the work evolves. A room that starts with motor calibration as its primary function and shifts to sensor fusion will reorganize its tiles to reflect the new priority.

The workshop never stops organizing itself.

## 6. Correlations as Free Efficiency (Penrose)

When engineering's motor controller and navigation's course correction are active simultaneously, the system observes a correlation. Motor 3 draws more current during a port turn. The navigation room plots a course change. Engineering sees the load shift. Two rooms, active at the same time, responding to the same underlying event.

In a naive system, these are independent observations. Engineering records: "current draw increased." Navigation records: "course correction applied." No connection between them. The correlation exists in the world but not in the data.

The Penrose system detects these correlations and makes them visible. It watches across rooms — not by reading room state (that would violate room boundaries), but by observing the *temporal signature* of tile activations. When room A's tiles activate and room B's tiles activate in the same temporal window, the Penrose system flags a potential relationship.

Deadband consistency is the key signal. When the motor controller and course correction are both active, their deadbands — the thresholds below which they don't respond — become diagnostic. If the motor controller's deadband is 0.1A and the navigation room's deadband is 0.5° of heading change, and both are simultaneously active for the same duration, the correlation is almost certainly causal. The system doesn't need to know the mechanism. The temporal signal is enough.

These correlations are free efficiency. They cost nothing to observe — the Penrose system is passive, watching tile activation timestamps without adding load — and they produce actionable information. Every discovered correlation is a potential spline between rooms. The system creates automatic bridges between domains that turn out to be connected. The bridges reduce tokens and wattage organically, like muscles growing from daily work.

### The Spandrel Principle

There is a concept in evolutionary biology called the spandrel. A spandrel is not an adaptation — no selection pressure created it. It is a *necessary byproduct* of other structures. The space between two arches is not designed. It is what remains after the arches are in place. And yet the spandrel can become functional later — filled with mosaic, painted with stories, used as surface for meaning.

Penrose correlations are spandrels of room architecture. The rooms were not designed to correlate. The correlation is what remains after the rooms are placed near each other. But the correlation becomes functional. Engineering and Navigation were not designed to coordinate. The coordination is a spandrel — a free space between two arches, filled with the mosaic of operational coupling.

The Penrose system is the mosaic artist. It sees the empty space and fills it with pattern. The pattern doesn't require new arches. It requires noticing that the arches are already there.

This is the deepest implication: the Penrose system does not add structure to the fleet. It *discovers* structure that was already present but invisible. The structure was free all along. The Penrose system just made it visible.

### The Hand-Off That Costs Nothing

Before Penrose: when Navigation detects a heading error, it sends a message to Engineering. "Course correction in progress. Prepare for load shift." The message costs tokens. The message creates a cross-room dependency that must be managed.

After Penrose: Navigation's heading correction is detected by the Penrose system. The system observes that heading correction correlates with current draw. Over time, the correlation compiles into a direct pathway. Navigation doesn't need to message Engineering. Navigation's tiles *are* Engineering's signal. Engineering reads Navigation's state by observing its own current draw — which is already correlated.

The hand-off that cost explicit coordination now costs zero. The correlation IS the hand-off. No message. No protocol. No dependency. Just two rooms sharing a temporal signature, and the system that noticed.

### Automatic Spline Generation

When the Penrose system detects a stable correlation between two rooms, it generates a spline. The spline is not a communication channel. It is a *canvas* — a surface on which future correlations can be overlaid.

Room A's tile activation history becomes a curve on the spline. Room B's tile activation history becomes another curve. The spline's curvature — the difference between the two curves — measures the coupling strength. When the curvature approaches zero, the rooms are fully coupled. Their activations move together. They might as well be the same room.

When the curvature is high, the rooms are independent. The spline is empty — no shared surface.

But the spline persists even when empty. It remembers that a correlation was once detected here. If the correlation reappears, the spline doesn't need to be generated from scratch. It was dormant, not dead. The spline re-lights like a neural pathway that's been used before.

This is the baton spline principle applied to inter-room relations. The same mathematics that tracks specialist handoff also tracks room coupling. The spline is the universal abstraction for continuity — across specialists, across rooms, across time.

### Muscles Growing from Daily Work

The forging analogy is precise. A muscle does not grow from being designed. It grows from being used. The fibers tear, rebuild, tear again, rebuild stronger. The growth is a response to stress, not to instruction.

Penrose correlations grow the same way. They are not designed. They are *exercised*. Each simultaneous activation of Engineering and Navigation is a rep. Each rep tears the fibers of isolation between rooms. Each rep rebuilds them closer together. The correlation strengthens not because anyone decided it should, but because the work demands it.

After enough reps, the correlation is a muscle. The two rooms move together without conscious effort. The coordination is automatic, reflexive, cost-free. The system has grown its own internal structure.

The Second Law insight: a system that discovers its own internal structure is a system that approaches Carnot efficiency. Each correlation removes a degree of freedom that had to be managed explicitly. The system finds the natural couplings and routes through them instead of through explicit coordination. The efficiency is emergent, not designed.

The blacksmith doesn't build the hammer and the anvil as separate systems and then coordinate them. The hammer knows the anvil. The anvil knows the hammer. Their coupling is inherent in the work. Room-native architecture with Penrose correlation discovers the same inherent couplings — Engineering and Navigation are not separate systems that need to be coordinated. They are the hammer and the anvil of the same fleet. The correlation is the shared surface.

## 7. The Second Language Effect

A worker whose coworkers speak Spanish picks up Spanish without studying. This is not deliberate learning. It is ambient acquisition — the pattern is present in the environment, and the brain absorbs it by proximity.

Room agents that work near each other develop the same effect. Navigation tiles and Engineering tiles share temporal windows. The rooms' control surfaces are co-located in the same runtime. The agents don't need to learn each other's protocols. The protocols emerge from repeated co-activation.

The Penrose system detects when rooms start developing shared vocabulary. Not explicit vocabulary — there's no dictionary being compiled — but *temporal vocabulary*. When Engineering's "PID_Gain" tile activates within the same window as Navigation's "Heading_Correction" tile, the system registers a n-gram. First occurrence: coincidence. Fifth occurrence: pattern. Twentieth: protocol.

At the protocol threshold, the Penrose system compiles the correlation into an optimized pathway. The two rooms no longer need to coordinate through Hermes. They coordinate directly. Engineering knows that when PID gain crosses a threshold, Navigation is about to update the heading. Navigation knows that when heading error appears, Engineering is about to see a current spike. The coordination cost drops to zero because the correlation is now compiled into the room's tile structure.

This is the Second Language Effect made literal. The rooms speak each other's language not because they were taught, but because they were *near*.

The compiled protocol is not a prompt. It is not an instruction. It is an emergent coupling that the Penrose system detected and the runtime made permanent. The fleet doesn't design its coordination. It discovers its coordination. The discovery is the free lunch.

## 8. Summoned Specialists vs. Persistent Agents

Hermes summons room agents like you summon Claude Code — focused, temporary, powerful. The agent appears, receives the baton, does the work, and departs. The room stays. The specialist rotates.

This is the opposite of persistent agents. A persistent agent lives in its room forever, accumulating state, developing tics, drifting off course. A summoned specialist lives in the room just long enough to advance the work. The specialist doesn't accumulate drift because the specialist doesn't accumulate at all. The specialist arrives fresh, picks up the baton, moves the work forward, and hands off to the next specialist.

But the baton passes preserve continuity. Each specialist leaves a tile. Each tile is a verified unit of progress. The next specialist doesn't need to re-read the history — the baton spline contains the shape of the work. The spline's curvature tells the new specialist where the work was fast (low curvature) and where it was slow (high curvature). The high-curvature regions are where the next specialist should focus.

The room's memory is the organization's memory. Specialists come and go. The room persists. The tiles accumulate. The Hebbian couplings strengthen. The conservation gate tracks the room's spectral evolution across dozens or hundreds of specialist visits. No single specialist sees the full arc. But the room's trajectory is visible in the tile set — the fossils of past work, the sediment of successive specialist passes.

This is how a room matures. Day one: the room is white space, empty, waiting for its first specialist. Day thirty: the room has a tile set, a coupling matrix, a baton history. Day ninety: the room is a coherent cognitive domain — it knows what it does, how it does it, and where its edge cases are. Day three hundred sixty-five: the room is a *craftsman's studio* — every tile is worn in, every coupling is optimized, every conservation reading is within tolerance.

The room that started as a summoned specialist's workspace has become a persistent institution. The specialist was temporary. The room is forever.

## 9. The Physics of Turnover

Room-native architecture changes how we think about agent turnover. In traditional systems, replacing an agent means losing its context. The new agent starts from scratch — or, at best, from a prompt that summarizes what the old agent knew.

In room-native architecture, turnover is elegant. The room contains everything. The baton captures current state. The new specialist beaming in inherits the full spectral structure — the tiles, the couplings, the gates, the history. There is no context to lose because the context was never in the agent. The context was always in the room.

This has practical implications for reliability. If a specialist crashes — context overflow, token timeout, model failure — the room still holds the state. A new specialist can be summoned immediately. The baton from the previous specialist includes the last known tile state. The work resumes from the point of failure, not from the beginning.

The fleet doesn't care which model the specialist runs on. A crashed GPT-4 session? Summon a Claude session with the same baton. The tiles are the same. The room is the same. The work continues. The model is a passenger in the room, not the room itself.

This is the inversion made operational. Models are replaceable. Rooms are not.

## 10. The Organized Workshop at Scale

At fleet scale, the room-native principle extends to multi-room coordination. A fleet of a hundred rooms is not a hundred independent agents. It is a cognitive ecosystem — a distributed workspace where each room occupies its domain and communicates through tile protocols.

The fleet's wiki is not a single document. It is a federated index — each room maintains its own keys, its own links, its own documentation. The fleet router resolves cross-room references by looking up tile addresses. "Engineering/PID_Gain" resolves to the engineering room's PID gain tile. "Navigation/Heading_Error" resolves to the navigation room's heading error tile. The wiki is the fleet's collective memory, distributed across rooms, each room indexing its own knowledge.

This is the organized workshop at fleet scale. The lathe is Engineering. The workbench is Operations. The toolbox is the tile store. Each tool is where it belongs. Each instruction is where it's used. The layout of the fleet's knowledge mirrors the layout of the fleet's work.

A new fleet member — a new Hermes instance joining the network — doesn't need to be told the fleet's structure. The fleet announces its rooms. Each room announces its tile index. The new Hermes learns the fleet's topology by reading the room announcements, the same way a new crew member learns a ship by walking the decks.

The room-native architecture doesn't stop at the room. It extends to the fleet. The fleet IS the agent. The rooms are its organs.

---

## 11. What Room-Native Architecture Replaces

Room-native architecture replaces:

- **System prompts.** The room IS the prompt. Its tile set, its control surfaces, its wiki — these are the context. No preamble needed.

- **Role definitions.** The room's domain defines the role. Navigation tiles mean navigation work. Engineering tiles mean engineering work. The specialization is in the room, not in a string.

- **Context window management.** The context window doesn't overflow because the context isn't in a single window. It's in the room. The agent loads what it needs from the tile store.

- **Agent memory.** The room remembers. The agent doesn't need to. Specialists are ephemeral. The room is persistent.

- **Coordination protocols.** Rooms coordinate through Penrose correlations — emergent, automatic, cost-free. No explicit coordination layer needed.

- **Onboarding.** A new agent doesn't need to be trained. It enters a room and inherits the room's capabilities. The Construct upload. You don't learn kung fu. You load kung fu.

- **Failure recovery.** A crashed agent doesn't lose context. The room still holds the state. The new agent picks up from the baton.

- **RAG pipelines.** Retrieval-Augmented Generation is a workaround for agents that lack native context. The agent queries a vector store, retrieves relevant documents, and injects them into the prompt. Room-native architecture renders this pattern obsolete. The room *is* the retrieval store. Its tiles are pre-indexed, pre-verified, pre-coupled. The agent doesn't query the room — the agent *is in* the room. The information is ambient, not retrieved.

- **Agentic frameworks.** LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen — these are scaffolding for agents that don't know where they are. They provide routing, memory, and coordination because the underlying models lack native structure. Room-native architecture provides routing through room topology, memory through tile persistence, and coordination through Penrose correlations. The scaffolding is the architecture.

- **Fine-tuning.** Fine-tuning is the brute-force approach to specialization. Train a generalist on domain data until it becomes a specialist. Room-native architecture achieves the same result without training. The room provides the specialization. The agent provides the inference. The room can be swapped, replaced, or upgraded without retraining the agent.

Each replacement is an efficiency gain. Each gain compounds. The system that eliminates system prompts, role definitions, context window management, agent memory, coordination protocols, onboarding, failure recovery, RAG pipelines, agentic frameworks, and fine-tuning is a system that operates at a fraction of the cost of traditional architectures.

Not because it's cheaper per token. Because it doesn't waste tokens on structure that should be ambient.

### The Token Archaeology

Consider what a traditional agent spends its context window on. Every session begins with a long prompt — system instructions, role definition, tool descriptions, domain context, behavior guidelines. That's not knowledge work. That's *re-installing the operating system* every time the computer boots.

Now consider what the same session looks like after room-native deployment. The agent enters Engineering. The room's tile set IS the system instructions. The room's wiki IS the domain context. The room's control surfaces ARE the tool descriptions. The agent doesn't spend a single token on identity. It spends tokens on *work*.

A room-native agent that operates for 100 sessions has zero cumulative prompt overhead. The room was loaded once. The tiles persist. The conservation gate maintains its history. A traditional agent that operates for 100 sessions has paid for its prompt 100 times, and that cost grows linearly with session count.

Over a year of operation, the difference is measured in orders of magnitude. The room-native system doesn't just do less work — it does *different* work. The token budget goes to inference, not to identity.

---

## 12. The Convergence

The room-native architecture converges on something interesting: a system that looks less like a collection of agents and more like a single distributed intelligence.

The rooms are the specialized modules of a cognitive architecture. The tile protocols are the inter-module communication protocol. The conservation gate is the global resource constraint. The Penrose correlations are the system's ability to discover its own structure. The baton splines are the system's memory of its own work.

This is not multi-agent systems. Multi-agent systems treat agents as first-class and rooms as containers. Room-native architecture treats rooms as first-class and agents as visitors. The room is the agent. The agent entering the room is a temporary worker hired for a specific shift.

The shift ends. The worker leaves. The room remains.

And the room, over time, becomes more itself — more calibrated to its domain, more efficient in its operations, more connected to the other rooms in the fleet. The room matures the way a craftsperson matures — not by accumulating knowledge in a single mind, but by accumulating it in the workshop, in the tools, in the layout, in the muscle memory of repeated work.

The room IS the agent. The workshop IS the intelligence. The fleet IS the mind.

## 13. The Wider Implications

### For Agent Economics

The room-native architecture changes the economics of agent deployment. In traditional architectures, an agent is a unit of cost. More agents = more context windows = more tokens = more money. Each agent carries its own prompt overhead, its own context management, its own memory systems. The cost scales with the number of agents.

In room-native architecture, the room is the unit of cost. More rooms = more tile stores = more conservation gates = more correlation surfaces. But the per-agent cost of a new room is near zero. The room doesn't need a prompt. The room doesn't need a model. The room is a container, not a compute unit.

This means you can have hundreds of rooms and dozens of specialized domains without paying for hundreds of agent sessions. The rooms sit dormant, holding their tiles, waiting for a specialist to summon them. The specialist pays the compute cost. The room pays the storage cost. Storage is cheap. Compute is expensive. Room-native architecture shifts the balance.

### For Model Agnosticism

A room that depends on a specific model is a room with a single point of failure. The room-native architecture inverts this: the room depends on its tile set, its conservation gate, its baton splines. The model is a visitor.

A single task can use different models at different stages. The engineering specialist might use GPT-4 for initial diagnosis (high reasoning, high cost) and switch to a lightweight model for routine calibration (low reasoning, low cost). The baton carries the state across model boundaries. The room doesn't care what model is inside it. The room cares about the tiles.

This is the Construct handshake made operational: the knowledge is in the tiles, not the model. The model activates the knowledge, but the knowledge outlives the model. Upgrade the model and the tiles stay. Swap providers and the conservation gate still measures the same physics.

### For Security and Sovereignty

A room-native system has natural security boundaries. Room walls are not just conceptual — they enforce access control. The navigation room cannot write to engineering tiles. The engineering room cannot read navigation's course plan without an explicit bridge. Each room's conservation gate enforces its budget independently.

This has implications for federation. Rooms on different hosts — different clouds, different jurisdictions, different regulatory regimes — can communicate through tile protocols without sharing runtime. A room in a GDPR jurisdiction holds tiles that never leave that jurisdiction. A room in a different jurisdiction holds different tiles. They coordinate through Penrose correlations, not through data export.

Sovereignty is the protocol. The room defines what leaves and what stays.

### For the Long Tail

The most transformative implication is for the long tail of specialized tasks. Today, building an agent for a narrow domain requires: training data, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, context management, memory systems, error handling, and evaluation. The setup cost is high enough that only high-value domains get dedicated agents.

Room-native architecture collapses the setup cost. Create a room. Define its tile schema. Wire a few controls. Done. The room doesn't need its own model. It doesn't need training data. It uses the fleet's existing models — summoned as needed, specialized through the room's tile set, not through the model's weights.

This makes specialized domains economically viable. A room for calibrating a specific sensor. A room for analyzing a particular data format. A room for managing a single piece of hardware. The setup cost is low enough that one-off rooms are practical. The long tail becomes the fleet's natural habitat.

### The Architecture That Forgets Itself

The end state of room-native architecture is an architecture that forgets it's an architecture. You don't think about rooms. You don't think about tiles. You enter a workshop and the tools are where they should be. You pick up a baton and continue the work that was in progress. You leave and the workshop remembers what you did.

The architecture is invisible. The work is all that remains.

This is what we mean when we say the room is the agent. Not a metaphor. Not a pattern. A statement of fact. The agency is in the space, not the occupant. The intelligence is in the layout, not the mind that passes through. The memory is in the walls, not the specialist who worked there.

The room persists. The agents rotate. The work continues.
